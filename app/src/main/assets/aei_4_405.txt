SIGNAL COMMUNICATION

Credits: 4 3+1+0
Objectives:

Familiarize the students with theoretical aspects of signal communication. Generate awareness in students about practical issues.
Give the students an application sense.

Module 1

An overview of electronic communication systems: block diagram of communication system, analogue versus digital, modulation multiplexing.
Basic concepts of signals: signal, signal characteristics.
Basic concepts of telemetry: signal transmission over wires using voltage, current and frequency – issues related to long distance transmission: signal attenuation, phase delays
– need for wireless telemetry – types of modulations used (only introduction, details in another module).

Module 2

Basic concepts of noise:, noise, noise spectrum, noise figure and noise temperature; Bandwidth requirements, effect of limiting bandwidth; signal attenuation and transmission distance; considerations of filter selection for suppression of noise: bandwidth, amplitude response, phase response.
Emi and related issues: grounding – shielding – twisted pair – twisted shielded pair - ground loop – guarding techniques.

Module 3

Introduction to digital communication: components of digital transmission system – advantages of digital transmission – analogue and discrete sinusoids – A/D conversion – sampling – sampling theorem- sampling in practical situations involving a range of frequencies and noise – aliasing error - filter order to minimize aliasing error - D/A conversion – channel capacity; Pulse Modulation concept and basic scheme: PAM, PWM, PPM, PCM, Delta modulation.
FDM and telemetry- IRIG standards for telemetry.

Module 4

Introduction to fibre optic communication: Light propagation in glass fibres; optical communication system: system components, transmitters – fibre channel – light detectors; transmitter concepts: sources, optical switches, modulation;
optical fibres: step index fibre, graded index fibre, single mode and multi mode fibres - fibre power loss terms; channel multiplexing: TDM, FDM: modulation formats; optical receivers: detectors, optical isolators.
 
Module 5
