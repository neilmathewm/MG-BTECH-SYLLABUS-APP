Objectives

•	To conduct various tests on DC machines and transformers and to study their performance 

1.	Study of 3-point and 4-point starters for D.C machines – mode of connection – Protective arrangements 

2.	OCC of self and separately excited D.C machines – critical resistances of various speeds. Voltage built-up with a given field circuit resistance. Critical speed for a given field circuit resistance 

3.	Load test on shunt and compound generator – deduce external, internal and armature reaction characteristics. Find load critical resistance. 
4.	Characteristics of D.C series machine as motor and generator. 
5.	Swinburne’s and retardation test on D.C machines. 
6.	Brake test on D.C shunt, compound motors and determination of characteristics. 
7.	Hopkinson’s test on a pair of D.C machines. 
8.	Separation of losses in a D.C machine. 
9.	Field’s test on D.C machine. 
10.	Polarity, transformation ratio tests of single phase transformers 
11.	O.C and S.C tests on single phase transformers – calculation of performance using equivalent circuit – efficiency, regulation at unity, lagging and leading power factors. Verification by direct loading. 

12.	Sumpner’s test on single phase transformers. 
13.	O.C and S.C tests on three-phase transformers. 
14.	Scott connection – check for 2 phase – predetermination of primary current for balanced and unbalanced secondary currents – verification by actual loading. 
15.	Parallel operation and load sharing of two single phase dissimilar transformers. 
16.	Separation of losses of single phase transformer into hysteresis and eddy current losses.
