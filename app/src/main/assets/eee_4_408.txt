2.	BJT, FET and UJT characteristics. 
3.	Design and testing of clipping and clamping circuits 
4.	Design and testing of RC integrator and differentiator circuits. 
5.	Design and testing of rectifier circuits – Half wave – Full wave (centre – tapped and bridge) circuits. Filter circuits. 
6.	Design and testing of Zener Shunt and Transistor Series Voltage Regulator. 
7.	Design and testing of RC coupled amplifier– frequency response. 
8.	Design and testing of Feedback amplifiers. 
9.	Design and testing of FET amplifier. 
10.	Sweep circuits – UJT and BJT based sweep generators – sweep circuit using constant current source (BJT). 
11.	Design and Testing of RC phase-shift Oscillator and LC Oscillator. 
12.	Design and Testing of Astable and Bi-stable Multi-vibrators.
