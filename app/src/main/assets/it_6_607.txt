IT010 607 NETWORK PROGRAMMING LAB

Teaching scheme Credits: 2 3 hours practical per week


Objective:

•	To impart a solid foundation of the state of the art trends in computer networking and to provide a hands on experience of the same. The lab aims to give an overarching insight to all arenas of networking. The experiments may be taken up with the intention to solidify the foundations of the basic networking course. The simulation experiments are included to have familiarization of the architecture and internal working of the tool and to equip the students with a free to use mindset afterwards. 

1	Java network programming – 

1.1	Processing Internet Addressing 

1.2	Applications with UDP datagram and sockets 

1.3	implementation of TCP/IP client and server 


2	Unix Network Programming 

2.1	TCP and UDP Socket programming and applications 

2.2	Client-server using RPC 

2.3	Concurrent Server using Threads or Process 

2.4	Implementations of PC-to-PC file transfer using serial port and MODEM. 

3	Simulation of ARP/RARP. 

4	Simulation of GoBackN, Selective Repeat or Sliding Window protocol. 

5	Remote Procedure Call (RPC) programming. 

6	Study of Network Simulators (NS2 / Glomosim) 

6.1	Simulation of different network topologies 

6.2	Performance analysis of routing protocols both for wired, wireless networks
