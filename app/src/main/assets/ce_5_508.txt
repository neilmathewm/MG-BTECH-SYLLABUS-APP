CE010 508 GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY


Teaching Scheme	Credit:2

3 hours practical per week.


Objective:

To practice the different experiments for determination of index properties and strength of soil and to develop confidence in students to assess the suitability of soil for various construction activities


List of Experiments:

1.	Determination of specific gravity, water content and particle size distribution by hydrometer method / pipette method. 
2.	Determination of field density of soil by sand replacement method and core cutter method. 
3.	Determination of Atterberg limits. 
4.	Proctor’s compaction tests (light and heavy). 
5.	Permeability tests for cohesive and cohesionless soil. 
6.	Direct shear test. 
7.	Triaxial shear test. 
8.	Unconfined Compression test. 
9.	Vane shear Test. 
10.	Consolidation test. 
11.	Study on Collection and Field Identification of Soil and Sampling Techniques.
