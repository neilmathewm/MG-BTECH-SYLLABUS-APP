CE010 601 DESIGN OF STEEL STRUCTURES

Teaching scheme:	Credits: 4
2 hour lecture and 2 hour tutorial per week

Objective:

To familiarize the fundamental aspects of structural behaviour and design of steel structures satisfying the requirements such as safety,feasibility and economy of steel structures.

Module 1 (12 hours)

Loading standards - I.S structural sections - I.S specifications –Design Philosophies-Working stress method and Limit state method - design of tension members –bolted and and welded connections - design of simple and compound beams - laterally supported and unsupported.(Design examples based on Limit state method only. )

Module 2 (12 hours)

Compression members - design of columns - short and long columns - axial and eccentric loading - built up columns- moment resisting connections - lacing and battening - column base - slab base - gusseted base.

Module 3 (15 hours)

Water tanks – rectangular and circular steel tanks – connections - analysis and design of supporting towers.

Module 4 (10 hours)

Light gauge steel structures - introduction - type of sections - local buckling - stiffened and multiple stiffened elements – Design of beams with lateral supports only.

Module 5 (11 hours)

Chimneys- types - self supporting and guyed – stresses in chimneys – design of chimney stack, breech opening, base plate, connections and foundations.( Design of self supporting chimney only.)

Note: Only Sketches required. Detailed drawing in drawing sheets not required
