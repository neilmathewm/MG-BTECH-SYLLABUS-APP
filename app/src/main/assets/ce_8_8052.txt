CE010 805G02 ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNIQUES

(ELECTIVE IV)
Teaching scheme:	Credit: 4

2 hours lecture and 2 hours tutorial per week

Objective:

o To understand the basic concept of various forms of Environmental Pollution o To develop knowledge in control techniques for Environmental Pollution

Module 1 (12hrs)

Introduction to environmental pollution

Air pollution – Sources – Criteria pollutants – Control of gaseous pollutants (adsorption, absorption, reaction and other methods) – Control of particulate pollutants (settling chambers, cyclone separation, Wet collectors, fabric filters, electrostatic precipitators)– Automobile pollution control

Module 2 (12hrs)

Water pollution – Sources – Various Pollutants – Treatment and control methods – Physico-chemical and Biological Treatments – Screening, skimming, sedimentation, coagulation, Filtration, Trickling Filters, Activated sludge process, Oxidation ponds, high rate anaerobic methods (design not needed)

Module 3 (12hrs)

Industrial Pollution - Characteristics of industrial wastes: physical, chemical and biological. Pretreatment of industrial wastes: waste volume reduction, waste strength reduction - neutralization, equalization and proportioning.

Theories of treatments processes: sedimentation flotation coagulation - evaporation & ion exchange – lagooning - activated sludge treatment - High rate anaerobic treatment.

Module 4 (12hrs)

Solid waste management: Type and source of solid waste, characteristics, collection, transportation and processing- Waste minimization strategies – Reduction - Recycling – Reuse – Disposal - composting, sanitary landfill, incineration, .

Module 5 (12hrs)

Noise pollution: Sources, effects of noise pollution, control measures.

Administrative and Legislative control of environmental pollution. Important Environmental rules and regulations, environmental protection laws and acts.
