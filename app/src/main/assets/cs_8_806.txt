CS010 806: Computer Graphics Lab


Teaching scheme	Credits: 2

3 hours practical per week

Objectives

•	To acquaint the students with the implementation of fundamental algorithms in Computer Graphics. 

I.	Experiments to implement the following: ( first 3 weeks) 

1.	DDA Algorithm 

2.	Bresenham's Line drawing Algorithm for any slope. 
3.	Mid-point Circle Algorithm. 
4.	2D Transformations 


II. Experiments to implement the following:


1.	3D Rotations on a cube (about any axis, any general line) controlled by keyboard navigation keys. 
2.	3D Rotations on a cube with hidden surface elimination.(keyboard controlled) 
3.	Composite transformations 
4.	Bezier cubic splines like screen saver 
5.	Any Fractal Construction (Koch curve ) 
6.	Animations using the above experiments.(eg.moving along curved path) 

Any experiment according to the syllabus of CS010 702 Computer Graphics can be substituted subjected to permission from competent authority.
