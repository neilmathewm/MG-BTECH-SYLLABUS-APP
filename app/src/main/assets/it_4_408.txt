IT 010 408: DATA STRUCTURES AND PROGRAMMING LAB

Teaching scheme Credits: 2 3 hours practical per week


Objectives

•	To provide experience on design, testing, and analysis of Algorithms and Data Structures. 
•	To acquaint the students with the Data Structures used in the Computer Science field. 

I.	Simple experiments to get familiarisation with C++ and Java. 

II.	Data structure implementations and applications like, 
1)	Representation of Polynomials using Arrays and Linked List and the different operations that can be performed on Polynomials 
2)	Representation of Sparse Matrix using Arrays and Linked List and the different operations that can be performed on Sparse Matrices 
3)	Representation of Stacks using Arrays and Linked List and the different operations that can be performed on Stacks 
4)	Representation of Queues using Arrays and Linked List and the different operations that can be performed on Queues 
5)	Representation of Double Ended Queue using Arrays and Linked List and the different operations that can be performed on Double Ended Queue 
6)	Representation of Priority Queues using Arrays and Linked List and the different operations that can be performed on Priority Queues 
7)	Representation of Binary Trees using Arrays and Linked List and the different operations that can be performed on Binary Trees 
8)	Representation of Graphs using Arrays and Linked List and the different operations that can be performed on Graphs 
9)	Infix, Postfix and Prefix conversions. 
10)	Different Sorting and Searching methods. 
11)	String representation using Arrays and Linked List and different pattern matching algorithms 
12)	Implementation and operations on B-Tree and B+Tree 

Any experiment according to the syllabus of IT010 405 can be substituted.
