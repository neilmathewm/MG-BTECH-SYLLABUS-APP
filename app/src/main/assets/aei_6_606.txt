MECHATRONICS (ELECTIVE-1)

3+1+0 Credits: 4

Objectives:

1.	To introduce the concept of integration of mechanical, electronic and computer system to achieve high precision and quality. 
2.	To help the students develop knowledge and skills that allow them to adopt interdisciplinary and integrated approach to engineering design. 
3.	To help the students understand modern integrated approach to development of precision mechanisms and machineries.
