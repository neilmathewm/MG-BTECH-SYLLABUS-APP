Teaching Schemes	Credits:4

2 hours lecture and 2 hours tutorial per week

Objectives:

• To impart a basic knowledge on pattern recognition and to give a sound idea on the topics of parameter estimation and supervised learning, linear discriminant functions and syntactic approach to PR.

•	To provide a strong foundation to students to understand and design pattern recognition systems.
