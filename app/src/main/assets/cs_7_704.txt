CS010 704 : Object Oriented Modeling and Design

Teaching scheme Credits: 3 2 hours lecture and 1 hour tutorial per week


Objective

•	To impart ideas on building systems through the object oriented modelling approach using the Unified Modelling Language. 


Module 1	(10 hours)

Introduction: object oriented development-modeling concepts – object oriented methodology – models – object oriented themes-Object Modeling– links and associations
– advanced links and association concepts – generalization and inheritance - grouping constructs – a sample object model
Advanced Object Modeling: aggregation – abstract classes – generalization as extension and restriction – multiple inheritance – metadata – candidate keys – constraints.

Module 2	(10 hours)

Dynamic modeling: Events and states – Operations – Nested state diagrams – Concurrency – Advanced dynamic modeling concepts – A sample dynamic model – Relationship of Object and Dynamic models.
Functional modeling: Functional models – Data Flow Diagrams - Specifying operations
– Constraints – A sample functional model – Relation of functional to Object and Dynamic models.

Module 3	(10 hours)

Analysis: Analysis in object modeling, dynamic modeling and functional modeling, Adding operations- Iterating the analysis
System Design: Breaking system into subsystems - Identifying concurrency-allocating subsystems to processors and tasks, managing of data stores. Handling of global resources- handling boundary conditions-Common Architectural Frameworks

Module 4	(8 hours)
Object Design: Overview of Object design – Combining the three models – Designing
algorithms  –  Design  optimization  –  Implementation  of  control  –  Adjustment  of
inheritance - Design of association – Object representation – Physical packaging –
Documenting design decisions-Comparison of methodologies
Module 5	(7 hours)
Unified Modeling language: Introduction, UML Diagrams – Class diagrams, Sequence diagrams, Object diagrams, Deployment diagrams, Use case diagrams, State diagrams, Activity diagram, Component diagrams – Case Study.
