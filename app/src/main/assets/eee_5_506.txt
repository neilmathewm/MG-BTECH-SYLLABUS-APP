EE 010 506: Microprocessors and Applications

Teaching scheme	Credits: 4

3 hours lecture and 1 hour tutorial per week

Objectives

•	To provide in-depth knowledge about 8085 microprocessor architecture, programming and interfacing. 
•	To introduce the 16-bit microprocessor 8086. 

Module 1 (10 hours)

Evolution of Processors – single chip microcomputer – Intel 8085 Microprocessor – signals architecture of 8085 – ALU – register organization – timing and control unit – microprocessor operations – instruction cycle – fetch, decode and execute operation – T-state, machine cycle and instruction cycle – timing diagram of opcode fetch, memory read, I/O read, memory write and I/O write cycles – wait state

Module 2 ( 13 hours)

Instruction set of 8085: Classification of instructions – different addressing modes – writing assembly language programs – typical examples like 8 bit and 16 bit arithmetic operations, finding the sum of a data array, finding the largest and smallest number in a data array, arranging a data array in ascending and descending order, finding square from look-up table.

Module 3 (11 hours)

Stack and Subroutines: Stack pointer – stack operations – call-return sequence – examples - Counters and time delays

Interrupts of 8085: Software and hardware interrupts- restart instructions – interrupt structure of 8085 – interrupt procedure- vectored and non-vectored interrupts – SIM and RIM instructions

Module 4 ( 12 hours)

Interfacing: Memory interfacing - ROM and RAM – interfacing I/O devices – address space partitioning – memory mapped I/O and I/O mapped I/O schemes – interfacing I/Os using decoders –programmable peripheral devices –8255 block diagram, programming simple input and output ports- DMA controller 8257-– interfacing of 8279 keyboard /display controller-8275 CRT controller

Module 5 (14 hours)

Intel 8086: Logical Pin diagram –Internal Architecture- pipelining- registers and flags - Operating modes: Minimum mode and Maximum mode.
Physical address generation – memory segmentation –even and odd memory banks. Addressing modes- instruction set classification – writing simple programs : arithmetic operations.
