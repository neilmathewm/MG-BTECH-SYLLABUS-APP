Teaching scheme	Credits: 2

3 hours practical per week

Objective:

To develop skills in computer aided drafting of electrical machines and lay-out of various electrical installations.

Familiarization of CAD Environment- Creating files/folders- Naming of files/folders-Basic features of CAD software like AutoCAD, ProE, CATIA etc. Drafting and modelling- Setting the work space/work bench- 2D drafting/sketching- Status bar/tool bar settings.

Simple drawing commands: line, ray, arc, circle, spline, ellipse, polygon etc., text, text editing

Edit commands – cut, copy, paste…, View commands- zoom, pan, redraw, regen …,

Modify commands- erase, copy, mirror, offset, move, rotate, trim, extend, arrays…., Object selection – Window, crossing, last, previous…

Preparation of 2D drawings -Dimensioning- Layer and block control, Block Editor, Dimension styles, Scaling, Editing Preparation of 2D drawings-X-ref- commands, Printing/ Plotting of drawings

Electrical CAD- Symbol libraries, Electrical User interface, icon menus, PCB drawing, Help system, Basic work flow, Project manager- opening, activating and closing projects

Drawing Examples- DC simplex Lap and Wave windings- Schematic wiring, Wires, Ladders, Wire numbering, Signal arrows…etc, Three phase ac double layer Lap winding and single layer Mush winding

Circuits- Multiple phase circuits, Electrical Schematic drawing of an 11kV indoor Sub-station, HT/LT panels with Circuit Breakers-Electrical Schematic drawings of MSB with supplies from a Transformer and Standby DG set, relays, indication lamps, metering etc.

Editing- Editing tools, Schematic symbols, Updating of blocks, Rail assembly.
