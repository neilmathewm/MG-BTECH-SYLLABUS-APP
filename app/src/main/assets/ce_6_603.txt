CE010 603 STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS II

Teaching scheme	Credits: 4
3 hour lecture and 1 hour tutorial per week

Objective:

To equip the students with the comprehensive methods of structural analysis of indeterminate structures
To give an introduction to Theory of Elasticity and Structural Dynamics.

Module 1 (10 hours)

Plastic theory – ductility of steel- plastic bending of beams- evaluation of fully plastic moment – plastic hinge – load factor – method of limit analysis- basic theorems- collapse load for beams and portal frames.

Module 2 (12 hours)

Approximate methods of frame analysis: Frames under lateral loading-portal method – cantilever method. Frames under vertical loading –substitute frame method.
Space frames – tension coefficients-tension coefficient method applied to space frames

Module 3 (12 hours)

Kani’s method-continuous beams & frames (without sway only).
Influence line diagrams for statically indeterminate structures: Muller Breslau’ s principle-Influence lines for reactions-shear force-bending moment-propped cantilever& two span continuous beams.

Module 4 (14 hours)

Elementary theory of elasticity: State of stress at point- stress tensor-equilibrium
Equations - stresses on arbitrary plane- principal stresses-strain components – strain tensor- compatibility equations- boundary condition equations Two dimensional problems- plane stresses - plane strain – compatibility equations in two dimensional cases- Airy’s stress functions

Module 5 (12 hours)

Introduction to Structural Dynamics-Dynamic systems and loads-Free or natural vibrations-Natural Frequency- Inertia force - -D’Alembert’s principle-Mathematical modeling of single degree of freedom systems- equivalent spring stiffness of combination of springs
