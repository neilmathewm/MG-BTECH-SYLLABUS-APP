IT 010 404: Theory of Computation

(Common with CS 010 406)

Teaching scheme Credits: 4 3 hours lecture and 1 hour tutorial per week


Objectives

•	To impart the basic concepts of theory of automata ,languages and computation. 

•	To develop understanding about machines for sequential computation, formal languages and grammars , and classification of feasible and intractable problems.
