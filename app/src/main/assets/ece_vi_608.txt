EC 010 608 MINI PROJECT LAB

Teaching Scheme

3 hours practical per week.	2 credits


The mini project will involve the design, construction, and debugging of an electronic system approved by the department. There will be several projects such as intercom, SMPS, burglar alarm, UPS, inverter, voting machine etc. The schematic and PCB design should be done using any of the standard schematic capture & PCB design software. Each student may choose to buy, for his convenience, his own components and accessories. Each student must keep a project notebook. The notebooks will be checked periodically throughout the semester, as part of the project grade.

In addition to this, the following laboratory experiments should also be done in the lab.



1.	555 applications 

2.	Light activated alarm circuit 

3.	Speed control of electric fan using TRIAC 

4.	Illumination control circuits 

5.	Touch control circuits 

6.	Sound operated circuits 

7.	Relay driver circuit using driver IC 

8.	Interfacing using Opto coupler 

9.	Schematic capture software (OrCAD or similar) familiarization. 

10.	PCB design software (OrCAD Layout or similar) familiarization. 

A demonstration and oral examination on the mini project also should be done at the end of the semester. The university examination will consist of two parts. One of the lab experiments will be given for examination to be completed within 60 to 90 minutes with a maximum of 30% marks. 70% marks will be allotted for the demonstration and viva voce on the mini project.
